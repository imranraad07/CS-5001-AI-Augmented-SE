Translate the following source code from C++ code to Python code.

Requirements:
- Preserve the original program logic and behavior exactly.
- Use idiomatic constructs and standard libraries appropriate for the target language.
- Maintain the original control flow, data structures, and error handling semantics.
- Do not introduce new features, optimizations, or refactoring unless required by the target language.
- Keep function and variable names as close as possible to the original, adapting only when the target language requires it.
- Include concise comments only where necessary to clarify non-obvious translations.
- Ensure all variables and functions maintain the same type as the original.
- Output only the translated code, with no explanations.
