## Original Code:

def median_numbers(a,b,c):
 if a > b:
    if a < c:
        median = a
    elif b > c:
        median = b
    else:
        median = c
 else:
    if a > c:
        median = a
    elif b < c:
        median = b
    else:
        median = c
 return median

## Refactored Code:

```python
def median_numbers(a, b, c):
    if a > b:
        if a < c:
            median = a
        elif b > c:
            median = b
        else:
            median = c
    else:
        if a > c:
            median = a
        elif b < c:
            median = b
        else:
            median = c
    return median
```
