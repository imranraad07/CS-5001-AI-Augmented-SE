## Original Code:

def is_nonagonal(n): 
	return int(n * (7 * n - 5) / 2) 

## Refactored Code:

```python
def is_nonagonal(n):
    return int(n * (7 * n - 5) / 2)
```

- Kept the integer conversion as in the original
- No changes to variable names or structure
- No additional functionality added
- No bug fixes applied
- Original behavior remains unchanged
- Code formatting remains consistent with input
