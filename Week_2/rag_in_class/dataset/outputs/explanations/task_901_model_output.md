## Original Code:

def smallest_multiple(n):
    if (n<=2):
      return n
    i = n * 2
    factors = [number  for number in range(n, 1, -1) if number * 2 > n]
    while True:
        for a in factors:
            if i % a != 0:
                i += n
                break
            if (a == factors[-1] and i % a == 0):
                return i

## Refactored Code:

```python
def smallest_multiple(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return n

    i = n * 2
    factors = [number for number in range(n, 1, -1) if number * 2 > n]

    while True:
        for a in factors:
            if i % a != 0:
                i += n
                break
            if a == factors[-1] and i % a == 0:
                return i
```

- Maintained the exact same logic and behavior as the original implementation
- Improved indentation consistency (4 spaces throughout)
- Added spaces around operators for better readability
- Kept all variable names and function names unchanged
- Preserved the original list comprehension structure
- Maintained the same while loop and for loop structure
- Kept the same conditional checks and return logic
- Ensured the code passes all existing tests without modification
- Improved overall code formatting while keeping functionality identical
